# WebMux active roadmap

Reviewed 2026-10-31 against the owner's recovered session and the open GitHub
issues. GitHub issues track implementation and remaining acceptance work.

## Connected WebMux servers: v1.4.0

[#238](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/238) tracks the owner-approved
multi-host architecture through release and distribution. The implementation
merged in [#239](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/pull/239), and
[v1.4.0](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/releases/tag/v1.4.0) is published
from `98b92e84c29d8ba85674026ef5b50f7c5c5927a4`. Exact-source
[CI](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/actions/runs/41245370881) and
[packaging](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/actions/runs/41245370869)
passed before publication. The issue retains the final publication, artifact
and Homebrew verification record.

Each host runs WebMux and owns its local terminals. A configured, authenticated
server directory supplies a local view, a selected-server view and an all-server
view, plus session-targeted agent messages. Rig and Agent Deck remain optional
orchestration layers. See [the server contract and setup](server-federation.md).

Implementation and acceptance:

- Peer origins and per-owner incoming grants, with server-held credentials and
  revocation checks.
- Compact server selection, labeled remote terminals, viewer-only hide/reconnect,
  explicit provider restart and independent unavailable-server warnings.
- Cross-host terminal messages with queue-admission semantics and source audit
  records; no claim of agent processing or task completion.
- Native two-server and real browser coverage, ownership/security checks,
  regression gates and a reviewed implementation PR.
- Consistent v1.4.0 release metadata, exact-commit CI and all four native
  packaging targets, followed by publication of 28 artifact/checksum files.
  GitHub-stored digests matched the qualified artifacts at publication.

[#240](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/240) resolved the newly
published lint-dependency advisory through compatible minimatch/brace-expansion
updates. The dependency-audit gate remains enabled and passed for this release.

## Next reliability work

[#236](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/236): bound Windows MSI smoke
operations and preserve progress/installer diagnostics after a stalled packaging
run. The stall is not established as a product regression. This is the next
reliability item after #238 release/distribution qualification.

## Integration and feature follow-ups

- [#194](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/194): remaining canonical
  Rig discovery, lifecycle/provenance contract and optional Agents-pane
  reconciliation. Its grid-centered UI work landed in #196; the issue remains
  open for its other acceptance requirements.
- [#200](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/200): remote Rig state over
  the outbound managed-host client. Review its relationship to #238 after the
  multi-server foundation ships; do not treat server federation as proof that
  this separate Rig contract is implemented.
- [#110](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/110): browser companion
  download/upload, durable profiles/controller lease, mobile/accessibility work,
  and real-provider/SSH authentication qualification.
- [#120](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/120): opt-in USB forwarding
  and real iPhone/Xcode qualification.

## External distribution and qualification

- [#91](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/91): WiX migration review,
  Apache-source browser package migration and deployment-specific component
  inventories.
- [#63](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/63),
  [#65](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/65), and
  [#152](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/152): Windows signing,
  WinGet publication and macOS Developer ID notarization.
- [#186](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/186): retained exact-release
  hosted qualification follow-up for v1.3.23. Verify its named runs before closing.

External credentials, hardware and native-target evidence remain distinct from
local implementation tests. Existing dependency/contributor PRs need their own
review and checks; they are not folded into #238 automatically.

## Built-in coordination default

[Issue #242](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/242) makes WebMux the
default built-in experience, with Agent Deck and Rig as explicit optional
integrations. Existing saved choices are retained. Selection and setup are
explained in [agent coordination](openrig.md).
[Issue #243](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/webmux/issues/243) tracks removing
the stable Homebrew dependency when the next release contains this change.
